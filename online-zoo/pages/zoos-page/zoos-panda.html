                  Giant pandas are very <span class= "panda-description__text_colored">unusual animals</span> 
                that eat almost exclusively <span class= "panda-description__text_colored">bamboo</span>, 
                which is very low in nutrients. Because of this, they have many unique adaptations 
                for their low-energy lifestyle. Giant pandas are solitary, with males and females 
                coming together only briefly to mate. Habitat loss is the primary threat to this species. 
                Its popularity around the world has helped the giant panda become the focus of successful 
                conservation programs.

              General Information:
            </h3>
            <p class="panda-description__details-paragraph">Giant pandas are bears and are members of the Order Carnivora. They are unique because, 
              although they evolved among the mostly carnivorous bear species of the world, their diet is
              vegetarian. Despite the availability of other plants, they feed almost exclusively on bamboo.
            </p>
            <p class="panda-description__details-paragraph">
              Giant pandas communicate with one another in dense bamboo forests primarily by scent. Males 
              regularly scent-mark the margins of their territories by adopting a “headstand” position to 
              mark a bamboo stalk with their anogenital glands.
            </p>
          
            <h3 class="panda-description__details-subtitle">
              Physical features and characteristics:
            </h3>
            <p class="panda-description__details-paragraph">
              The low nutrient value of bamboo figures prominently in the biology of the giant panda. 
              They have extremely powerful jaws and associated muscles to crunch through the woody stems of 
              bamboo. Each hand bears a specialized metacarpal bone in the wrist that functions as a thumb 
              would in humans, to allow them to grasp the circular bamboo stalks. While other herbivorous 
              animals, such as antelope, zebras, or rabbits, have very long digestive tracts, the giant panda 
              retains an essentially bear-like digestive tract. Thus, the digestive efficiency of the bamboo 
              they consume is quite low. Examination of the feces demonstrates that their food has been only 
              partially digested. The low nutrient value of their food and their low digestive efficiency 
              results in an animal that is constrained to a low-metabolism. This lifestyle explains why giant 
              pandas sleep so often and why they eat such enormous amounts of bamboo.
            </p>
            <h3 class="panda-description__details-subtitle">
              Lifestyle and reproduction:
            </h3>
            <p class="panda-description__details-paragraph">
              Females are fertile for only a very short period of time and exhibit delayed implantation. 
              Although twins are not unusual, a mother will typically only rear one cub. Adults are solitary, 
              with mating pairings being quite brief. The tiny cubs are altricial, or not born in an advanced 
              state of development, and are completely helpless, blind and deaf, and without the fur necessary 
              to regulate their own body temperatures. As a result, maternal care is extensive. Cubs do not 
              begin eating bamboo until they are around a year old.
            </p>
            <p class="panda-description__details-paragraph">
              When twins are born in zoos, extraordinary measures are taken to train the female to accept 
              swapping of her cubs regularly 24 hours a day, so that she only cares for one a time, but that 
              both receive adequate care.
            </p>
            <h3 class="panda-description__details-subtitle">
              Habitat:
            </h3>
            <p class="panda-description__details-paragraph">
              Their preferred cool and wet bamboo forests are found at elevations between 5,000 and 10,000 feet. 
              Cubs are raised in rocky crevices, dead trees, or caves.
            </p>
            <h3 class="panda-description__details-subtitle">
              Diet:
            </h3>
            <p class="panda-description__details-paragraph">
              Our animal care professionals offer each adult or subadult giant panda about 80 pounds of 
              various bamboo species per day, and they generally select and consume only about third of that. 
              They also are offered nutritious high-fiber biscuits and fruits such as apples or sweet potatoes.
